# gtglfw

Hi,

Is there a possibility of creating a GT driver in order to use GLFW library’s in/out - of course in ~~GUI~~ graphics version.

Also, is there a chance to make all of the updates to the newest version of the driver gtalleg?

This questions is not being asked just by myself, but also by other young programmers who are looking to use libraries for graphics (OpenGL and Vulkan) with the usage of Harbour.

Best regards,

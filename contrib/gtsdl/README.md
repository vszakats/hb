# gtsdl

Hi,

Is there a possibility of creating a GT driver in order to use SDL library’s in/out - of course in graphics version.

This questions is not being asked just by myself, but also by other young programmers who are looking to use libraries for graphics with the usage of Harbour.

Best regards,

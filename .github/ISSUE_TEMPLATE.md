# Please follow the general troubleshooting steps first:

- [ ] Have you read the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) document?
- [ ] Have you tested with the _latest_ 3.4 revision?
- [ ] If this was working before, do you know which one was the latest working
      revision?
- [ ] Does it also happen with latest
      [mainline](https://github.com/harbour/core) (3.2)?
- [ ] If this is an issue with a Cl\*pper legacy functionality, have you
      compared it against the original behavior of Cl\*pper itself?
- [ ] If this is an issue with 3.2 or a Cl\*pper incompatibility, have you
      reported this to
      [mainline](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/harbour-devel)
      already?

You may erase parts of this template not applicable to your Issue. Deleting
_all_ above points is considered rude though.

### Bug reports:

Please replace this section with a brief summary of your issue, including
self-contained example code, stdout/stderr output, platform/compiler and
version details.

### Notes:

In case of inquiries, questions, usage issues and general or feature specific
discussion, please use available public forums. Popular ones are listed in
the [README](../README.md#external-links).

Consider creating a [Pull Request](https://github.com/vszakats/harbour-core/pulls)

for issues falling outside the focus of this fork, f.e. any C compiler except
mingw/gcc/clang or regarding certain, non-priority or deprecated components
(f.e. Windows CE, hbtip, gtwvg/gtwvw, xhb) and feature requests in general.

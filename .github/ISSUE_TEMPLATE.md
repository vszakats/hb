# Please follow the general troubleshooting steps first:

- [ ] Have you read the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) document?
- [ ] Does the issue happen with the _latest_ 3.4 revision?
- [ ] If this was working before, do you know which one was the latest working revision?
- [ ] Does it also happen with [mainline](https://github.com/harbour/core) (3.2)?
- [ ] If this is an issue with a Cl\*pper legacy functionality, have you tested the original behavior with Cl\*pper itself?
- [ ] If this is an issue with 3.2 or a Cl\*pper incompatibility, have you reported this to [mainline](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/harbour-devel) already?

_You can erase any parts of this template not applicable to your Issue._

### Bug reports:

Please replace this section with a brief summary of your issue, including self-contained example code, stdout/stderr output, platform/compiler and version details.

### Notes:

In case of enquires, questions, usage issues and general or feature specific discussion, please use available public forums. Popular ones are listed in the [README](../README.md#external-links).

Please consider creating a [Pull Request](https://github.com/vszakats/harbour-core/pulls) to address any problem found. This is in particular welcome or even expected for issues falling outside the focus of this fork, f.e. any C compiler except mingw/gcc/clang or regarding certain, non-priority components (f.e. Windows CE, hbtip, gtwvg/gtwvw, xhb) and feature requests in general.

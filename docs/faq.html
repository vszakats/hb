<h3><a id="6"></a>2. About Harbour</h2>
<hr>
<h2><a id="7"></a>2.1. What is Harbour?<a id="WhatIsHarbour"></a></h2>
<p>Harbour is a
  <a href="#FreeSoftware">free software</a> compiler for the
  xBase superset language often referred to as Clipper (the language that is
  implemented by the compiler
  <a href="#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</a>).
  Harbour's chosen base implementation is, for the moment, the 5.2e version of
  <a href="#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</a>. This isn't to say that the
  additions found in 5.3 won't make it into Harbour, it simply reflects the
  fact that many Clipper programmers see 5.2e as the &quot;last best&quot;
  implementation of Clipper.
</p>
<p>If the 5.3 extensions to the language are important to you please feel free
  to
  <a href="#WhenFinished">contribute to the project</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="8"></a>2.2. Why develop Harbour?</h2>
<p>There are probably more reasons for developing Harbour than there are
  Harbour developers. To gain a better understanding of why some
  <a href="#FreeSoftware">free software</a> gets developed you might want to
  have a read of
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="9"></a>2.3. Who is developing Harbour?<a id="WhoDevelopers"></a></h2>
<p>Many people. There are a small handful of people who could be called the
  &quot;core development team&quot; but the actual set of people who are
  contributing to the project is constantly in flux. Anyone can join the
  &quot;development team&quot; and, if you've got something to offer the
  project, you'll be more than welcome.
</p>
<p>Anyone wondering who the core developers are should pop over to the
  <a href="/">Harbour project website</a> and look at the
  <a href="/crew.htm">crew list</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="10"></a>2.4. Who owns Harbour?</h2>
<p>Nobody <em>owns</em> Harbour but many people hold the copyright on portions of
  Harbour.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="11"></a>2.5. So who do I blame when it all goes wrong?<a id="Warranty"></a></h2>
<p>Harbour is
  <a href="#FreeSoftware">free software</a> and comes with
  <strong>no warranty</strong>. The warranty statement is that which is
  provided by the
  <a href="#GPL">GPL</a>:
<blockquote>
  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
  ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for
  more details.
</blockquote>
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="12"></a>2.6. How did Harbour get started?</h2>
<p>The idea of a
  <a href="#FreeSoftware">free software</a> Clipper compiler
  has been floating around for a long time and the subject has often cropped
  up in discussion on <a href="news:comp.lang.clipper">comp.lang.clipper</a>.
  Actual work to get something developed started
  early in 1999 when Antonio Linares <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.lang.clipper/D6_Q5GUKae8/T1AG-P2WSVsJ">started a thread</a> to
  discuss some ideas about developing a Clipper grammar using Lex and Yacc.
</p>
<p>The rest, as they say, is history (that history might form the basis of
  another document should I ever get the time to compile it).
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="13"></a>2.7. What is &quot;free software&quot;?<a id="FreeSoftware"></a></h2>
<p>In general terms free software is one phrase for describing software that
  comes with certain freedoms, the free doesn't speak about the price, it
  speaks about your freedoms to use the software. A common suggestion is that
  you think &quot;free speech&quot; instead of &quot;free beer&quot;.
</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a> for the Free
  Software Foundation's definition of &quot;free software&quot;.
</p>
<p>A related term is OpenSource, you can find out more about the idea of
  OpenSource at
  <a href="https://www.opensource.org/">https://www.opensource.org/</a>. You
  might also want to note that the FSF don't consider OpenSource and Free
  Software to be the same thing, see
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html</a>
  for more details.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="14"></a>2.8. So is Harbour in the public domain?</h2>
<p>No, Harbour isn't in the
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html">public domain</a>.
  Most parts of Harbour are copyrighted works and you should respect those
  copyrights as you would any other copyright. With a small number of exceptions
  each of the <a href="#WhoDevelopers">Harbour authors</a> have placed their
  code under Harbour's chosen license, currently that license is the
  <a href="#GPL">GPL</a> and/or the GPL with
  <a href="#HarbourException">Harbour exception</a>.
</p>
<p>Note, however, that some files that are part of harbour have been placed in
  the public domain.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="15"></a>2.9. What is the GPL?<a id="GPL"></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLv2">GPL</a> is
  the license of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU system</a>, it is a
  <a href="#FreeSoftware">free software</a> license. You might also hear it
  referred to as the
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html">Copyleft</a>.
</p>
<p>The GPL is currently the license under which parts of Harbour are released,
  other parts of Harbour are under the GPL plus the
  <a href="#HarbourException">Harbour exception</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="16"></a>2.10. Why was the GPL chosen as the license for Harbour?<a id="WhyGPL"></a></h2>
<p>That's really a question best asked of each of the Harbour copyright
  holders. A simple answer would be that the GPL is seen as one of the more
  restrictive <a href="#FreeSoftware">free software</a> licenses and, for
  that reason more than any other, it appeared to give the maximum amount of
  freedom and at the same time the correct degree of control over use and
  distribution.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="17"></a>2.11. What is the Harbour exception?<a id="HarbourException"></a></h2>
<p>There is one small wrinkle regarding the use of the GPL as the license for
  Harbour. Harbour comes in a number of parts, these can best be described as
  the compiler (including pre-processor), the virtual machine and the run-time
  library. The GPL dictates that anyone distributing binary versions of GPLd
  code must make an offer of providing the source and that the code linked
  against the GPLd code must also fall under the GPL. Failure to do so is a
  breach of license.
</p>
<p>In Harbour terms this means different things depending on which portion of
  Harbour you are considering. The compiler itself can live under the GPL, it
  isn't part of the run-time and so poses no problem. This isn't true for the
  <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.repo_slug }}/tree/{{ site.repo_branch }}/src/vm">HVM</a>
  and
  <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.repo_slug }}/tree/{{ site.repo_branch }}/src/rtl">RTL</a>
  because they get linked into your application and so would require that your
  code be distributed under a compatible license. While the Harbour developers
  would like to see you develop <a href="#FreeSoftware">free software</a> they
  have decided to let you make this choice.
</p>
<p>To solve this problem the developers have employed the &quot;Harbour
  Exception&quot;. This idea comes from the GPL exception used by <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html">guile</a>. In effect,
  the exception states that you must observe the GPL except when the code in
  question is being used as the HVM and RTL of an application compiled with
  Harbour.
</p>
<p>The wording of the exception currently reads:
<blockquote>
  The exception is that, if you link the Harbour libraries with other files to
  produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting executable
  to be covered by the GNU General Public License. Your use of that executable
  is in no way restricted on account of linking the Harbour library code into
  it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why the
  executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  This exception applies only to the code released by the Harbour Project under
  the name Harbour.  If you copy code from other Harbour Project or Free
  Software Foundation releases into a copy of Harbour, as the General Public
  License permits, the exception does not apply to the code that you add in
  this way.  To avoid misleading anyone as to the status of such modified
  files, you must delete this exception notice from them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  If you write modifications of your own for Harbour, it is your choice
  whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.
  If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice.
</blockquote>
  Please note that the original wording of the exception was based on an
  earlier version of the guile exception. That version of the exception was
  less verbose and less clear. The wording of that version read:
<blockquote>
  The exception is that if you link the Harbour Runtime Library (HRL) and/or
  the Harbour Virtual Machine (HVM) with other files to produce an executable,
  this does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the
  GNU General Public License. Your use of that executable is in no way
  restricted on account of linking the RTL and/or HVM code into it.
</blockquote>
The Harbour sources are being converted over to the new exception as each
copyright holder makes the change. The intention is that every item of
source that uses the Harbour exception will clearly use the more verbose
version.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="18"></a>2.12. So why don't you use the LGPL?</h2>
<p>Given
  <a href="#HarbourException">the above</a> it might be reasonable to
  ask why the Harbour developers didn't elect to use the
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">LGPL</a>
  instead. The reason simply comes down to the requirements of the LGPL and
  what can be reasonably asked of anyone who wishes to make use of Harbour.
</p>
<p>The LGPL requires that any binary distribution of the LGPLd code (in other
  words, an application compiled with Harbour and linked against the HVM and
  RTL) should be distributed in a method that allows the user to re-link the
  application against different and/or later copies of the code under the
  LGPL. This is an unreasonable and unworkable requirement as far as the
  Harbour developers are concerned.
</p>
<p>For the most part it would be fine on platforms where an application can be
  linked against a dynamic version of the HVM and RTL, but any platform that
  doesn't support dynamic linking (PC/MS/DR/Open/Free-DOS for example) would
  be effectively shut out of Harbour usage. The Harbour developers consider
  this to be a reduction of freedom and this isn't acceptable for free
  software.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="19"></a>2.13. Will my applications be affected by the GPL?</h2>
<p>No, the
  <a href="#HarbourException">Harbour exception</a> seeks to ensure
  that, when you build an application with Harbour, compiling with the Harbour
  compiler and linking against the HVM and RTL, your rights to license your
  own code are not in any way affected.
</p>
<p>Harbour's license is there to try and protect the freedom offered by the
  Harbour developers. Harbour's license isn't there to try and force you to
  choose a specific license.
</p>
<p>Be assured that it isn't the intention of the
  <a href="#WhoDevelopers">Harbour developers</a> that your applications will
  have to be released as
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>.
  Supporting free software would be the right thing to do but the Harbour
  developers have decided not to insist on this; we think it is more useful in
  this situation to set up Harbour's license so that it does not make any
  conditions on the status of your work that was built with and against
  Harbour.
</p>
<p>As always, don't take anyone else's word for this stuff, when in doubt, read
  the license. If you're still in doubt pay someone who knows what they are
  doing to read the license for you. Hopefully you do this with licenses for
  your other development tools, Harbour is no different, it has a license that
  you need to understand.
</p>
<hr>
<h3><a id="20"></a>3. Helping develop Harbour</h2>
<hr>
<h2><a id="21"></a>3.1. How do I get started?</h2>
<p>The first thing you should do is join the
  <a href="#DevMailList">developer's mailing list</a> and read the mail for
  a few days to get a feel for what is going on. You might also want to take
  a look at <a href="#MailArchives">the archives</a> too.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="22"></a>3.2. What C compiler should I use?<a id="WhatC"></a></h2>
<p>What C compiler do you want to use?</p>
<p>The
  <a href="#WhoDevelopers">Harbour developers</a> consider GNU
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">GCC</a> to be <em>the</em>
  supported compiler of the Harbour project, use of the
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">GCC</a> port for your chosen
  platform is encouraged.
</p>
<p>However, should you wish to use a different C compiler your contribution to
  make it work is more than welcome. Currently the following C compiler and
  platform combinations are supported by someone in the development team:
<ul>
  <li>
    Microsoft Windows
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">GCC</a>
        (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/">mingw-w64</a>)
      </li>
      <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 10/11/12</li>
      <li>IBM Visual Age for C++</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>

      <li>Watcom C/C++</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">GNU/Linux</a>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">GCC</a> (various versions).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    macOS/iOS
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
Instructions on how to build Harbour with the above compilers should reside
in the <code>doc</code> directory of the Harbour source tree. If such
documentation is missing please consider asking about it on the
<a href="#DevMailList">development mailing list</a> and, once you've got the
information, formatting it and placing it in the <code>doc</code> directory
to help others who may wish to ask the same question.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="23"></a>3.3. What other tools do I need?</h2>
<p>To build Harbour you'll need the following tools:</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A C compiler.
    <p>Please see the FAQ section entitled
      <a href="#WhatC">What C compiler should I use?</a> for more details on choosing a C compiler.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    A make utility.
    <p>Most platform/compiler combinations within Harbour make use of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU make</a>, some developers
      use other make utilities, you'll need to speak to them if you want to ignore
      the GNU make files.
    </p>
    <p>You should be able to find GNU make at:</p>

    <p>A snapshot of the source is made available on the
      <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/harbour-project/files/">Harbour
      project download web page</a>. Please be aware that this is an
      <strong>unstable</strong> snapshot. Using this source could make all sorts
      of horrible things happen - it might not even compile. You have been warned.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    The stable snapshot
    <p>Once in a while a stable snapshot of the Harbour source is made available
      from the
      <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/harbour-project/files/">download page</a>
      of the <a href="/">Harbour project website</a>. These snapshots are referred
      to as &quot;releases&quot; and are considered stable in that the source will
      compile and there are no known showstoppers in the compiler, virtual machine
      or run-time library.
    </p>
    <p>If you like to play with alpha quality software but want to feel safe doing
      so then a stable release is for you.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Direct CVS access
    <p>The best and most direct method of getting Harbour source is from the CVS
      server. This is where the
      <a href="#WhoDevelopers">Harbour developers</a>
      work on the source for Harbour (actually, they all work on their own
      machines, this server gives them, in effect, a virtual shared directory).
    </p>
    <p>If you intend to work with Harbour built from the CVS itself you should
      really consider subscribing to the
      <a href="#DevMailList">developer's mailing list</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Please note that if you do want to help develop Harbour then the last option
  is the best option (and, in the long term, the only useful option for all
  concerned).
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="25"></a>3.5. What is CVS and how do I use it?<a id="WhatIsCVS"></a></h2>
<p>Before proceeding you should probably have a good read of the
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140418005034/ximbiot.com/cvs/cvshome/docs/blandy.html">introduction to CVS by Jim Blandy</a>.
  Reading this document should save you a lot of confusion later
  on.
</p>
<p>To use the CVS server you first need to get a copy of the CVS client
  software for your operating system:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Microsoft Windows
    <p>See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429101637/www.cyclic.com/cvs/windows.html">www.cyclic.com/cvs/windows.html</a> for more details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    GNU/Linux
    <p>Many GNU/Linux distributions come with the CVS client packaged as part of
      the distribution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    macOS
    <p>See <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> for more details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    DOS 16-bit/32-bit
    <p>See the DOS section at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429101637/www.cyclic.com/cvs/other.html">www.cyclic.com/cvs/other.html</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Other
    <p>If you are building Harbour with an operating system not listed then please
      contact the FAQ maintainer with full details so that this list can be
      updated.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Once you have got your CVS client installed you can gain anonymous access to
  the Harbour CVS server. Depending on platform, the first thing you need to
  do is set the <code>CVSROOT</code> environment variable to:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
  <code>
    <pre>
:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/harbour-project
</pre>
  </code>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>In addition to the above some environments might require extra information.
  For example, the DOS, Windows and OS/2 CVS clients need to be given two
  extra environment variables, <code>HOMEDRIVE</code> and <code>HOMEPATH</code>. These two
  environment variables tell the CVS client where the source will live
  locally. For example, if your Harbour development directory is at
  <code>S:\FREESOFT\HARBOUR</code> you'd set:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
  <code>
    <pre>
SET HOMEDRIVE=S
SET HOMEPATH=\FREESOFT\HARBOUR\
</pre>
  </code>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Users of the Windows client have reported that the <code>HOMEPATH</code> environment
  variable must start with and finish with a directory separator. Users of the
  DOS client have reported that the <code>HOMEDRIVE</code> environment variable must
  end with a colon.
</p>
<p>Ensure that your harbour directory is created and change into it. Then run:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
  <code>
    <pre>
cvs login
</pre>
  </code>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>and press enter when prompted for a password. Now run:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
  <code>
    <pre>
cvs extract -P harbour
</pre>
  </code>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>to get a copy of the Harbour CVS repository (users of the DOS client have
  reported that it doesn't have the <code>extract</code> command and that the
  <code>checkout</code> command should be used instead, I'm also told that the CVS
  client on GNU/Linux requires that you use <code>checkout</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The CVS commands and directories are case sensitive: <code>harbour</code>
  must be in all lower case.
</p>
<p>Later, when you want to get changes from the CVS, you can do one of two
  things:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Repeat the <code>extract</code> command from your Harbour directory.</li>
  <li>From your Harbour directory run '<code>cvs update</code>'.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If you have problems after reading the above please consider reading the
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140418005034/ximbiot.com/cvs/cvshome/docs/blandy.html">CVS introduction</a>
  and also the documentation for the CVS client you've installed. If, after
  reading both those documents, you are still having problems you should drop
  a polite message into the <a href="#DevMailList">developer's mailing list</a>
  detailing your platform, environment, all the steps you performed and the
  exact nature of the problem.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="26"></a>3.6. How do I build Harbour?</h2>
<p>The method used to build Harbour may differ from platform to platform and
  even from tool set to tool set. Please have a good read of the files in the
  <code>doc</code> directory of the Harbour source.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="27"></a>3.7. What needs working on?<a id="WhatToDo"></a></h2>
<p>See <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{ site.repo_slug }}/{{ site.repo_branch }}/doc/todo.txt">TODO</a> in the root directory of the harbour sources.</p>
<p>If you're looking to get stuck into some Harbour development you'd do
  well to subscribe to the
  <a href="#DevMailList">developer's mailing list</a>, hang out there for a few days to get a feel for what is going on and
  then either start contributing bug fixes (always a good way of getting
  started) or simply announce your intention to work on an entry on the TODO list.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="28"></a>3.8. Are there any development guidelines?</h2>
<p>Not as such no. That said, if you are going to cut some code for Harbour you
  might want to consider the following random observations:
<ul>
  <li>Harbour is written in both C and itself. As much as possible we stick
    with ANSI C (any non ANSI code should be guarded with pre-processor
    directives).
  </li>
  <li>Too many comments are better than too few comments.</li>
  <li>An ounce of testing can save a ton of debugging. Please ensure that,
    when you change code, you attempt to compile and use Harbour before
    submitting changes.
  </li>
  <li>English is the nearest we've got to a common language. Where possible
    please code in, comment in and document in English.
  </li>
  <li>Please don't make use of code you don't have the right to use. For
    example, don't go copying
    <a href="#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</a> header
    files to make Harbour header files.
  </li>
  <li>Have fun.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="29"></a>3.9. Is it ok to extend the language with some spiffy new feature?</h2>
<p>As a rule, no. As
  <a href="#WhatIsHarbour">stated earlier</a> Harbour is
  designed, as much as possible, to be a
  <a href="#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</a> 5.2e compatible Clipper compiler (with some 5.3 bits
  thrown in when it makes sense). As such, until such a time as we're all done
  on the compatibility front, the
  <a href="#WhoDevelopers">Harbour developers</a> would prefer to keep the language as &quot;pure&quot; as
  possible.
</p>
<p>That said, if you've got an idea for something you think should be added to
  the language please feel free to make your case on the
  <a href="#DevMailList">developer's mailing list</a>. Please note that emails along the lines of
  &quot;I want feature <em>X</em> because I'd like to have it&quot; don't cut
  much ice. Emails to that effect that actually offer a working patch might
  cut a little ice. Preferably, you'll come to the list with a well thought
  out and documented case for the addition of a new language extension and
  you'll be willing to discuss the proposal.
</p>
<p>Also, don't be upset if it is rejected, this is
  <a href="#FreeSoftware">free software</a> after all, if you really feel that the extension is
  required you can maintain a patch in parallel or, if you really must (but
  we'd prefer if you didn't), you could maintain a forked distribution of
  Harbour.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="30"></a>3.10. So what's with all these language extensions then?</h2>
<p>Hey, come on, there aren't that many!</p>
<p>Seriously, ok, hands up, you've got us bang to rights. Harbour does include
  some extensions to &quot;standard&quot; Clipper but you'll notice that
  these extensions are, on the whole, either replacements for &quot;must
  have&quot; 3rd party add-ons that people used with
  <a href="#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</a> or they are a feature that is native to
  <a href="#ClipperCompilers">other Clipper compiler implementations</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="31"></a>3.11. I cannot code C, how can I help development? </h2>
<p>How about doing some Clipper (the language) coding? Parts of Harbour have
  been and can be written in itself. Why not look at
  <a href="#WhatToDo">what needs doing</a> in the run-time library and seeing what could be
  coded using normal Clipper code?
</p>
<p>Don't worry about speed for the moment, chances are the functions you're
  thinking about are not speed critical, even if they are someone can come
  along and, using your implementation as the base design, re-code it in C for
  extra speed (if re-coding will speed it up).
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="32"></a>3.12. I've got loads of Clipper code I can donate, what shall I do?</h2>
<p>Harbour isn't a project to create a repository of free Clipper code so,
  unless your code directly implements a core Clipper run-time library
  function it probably isn't a lot of use to Harbour.
</p>
<p>However, don't let your code go to waste, why not consider starting a
  non-compiler specific but cross-platform free software Clipper library that
  will benefit programmers using any of the
  <a href="#ClipperCompilers">Clipper compiler implementations</a>?
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="33"></a>3.13. I cannot submit Clipper code either, can I still help anyway?</h2>
<p>You could help out any number of ways. Documentation is one area where
  volunteers are needed (it's a dirty job but someone has to do it). Perhaps
  you could help maintain the
  <a href="#WhatToDo">TODO list</a>?
  How about creating and maintaining binary snapshots of each of the releases?
</p>
<p>Simply put, if you really want to help Harbour development, you'll find a
  way.

<h2><a id="38"></a>4.4. How do I remove myself from the mailing lists?</h2>
<p>Every email that comes from the Harbour mailing lists contains instructions
  for unsubscribing. The information is in the header of the email. For those
  people with MUAs that don't allow them to read such vital information here
  are the headers at the time of writing:

No matter what mailing list you are on it is always a good idea to never
subscribe unless you know how to unsubscribe. This can be as simple as
keeping the subscription confirmation message that many lists send out (they
often include instructions on how to unsubscribe).</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="39"></a>4.5. Are there any rules on the lists?</h2>
<p>There are no <em>rules</em> as such but you might want to consider the following
  guidelines:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Try to stay on topic. The
    <a href="#DevMailList">developer's list</a> is for Harbour design and development issues, the
    <a href="#UserMailList">user's list</a> is for Harbour usage discussion and
    the
    <a href="#DisMailList">discussion list</a> is for general Harbour
    discussion.
  </li>
  <li>Try not to mail binaries. Sometimes it is necessary on the development
    list, if so, try to keep the size down, the developer's list is <strong>very
    busy</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>Stick to plain text formatted email,
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204041319/www.expita.com/nomime.html">turn off</a> any HTML
    &quot;features&quot;, content is far more important than form in the
    Harbour lists.
  </li>
  <li>Stick to English. This isn't a UK/US/AU-centric thing, it just so
    happens that English is more widely comprehended than any other language
    available on the lists. If you use English you'll be read by the maximum
    number of people.
  </li>
  <li>Don't use the subject as the message. Single line messages where the
    message is in the subject don't carry a lot of information. Be verbose,
    you'll stand a better chance of being understood.
  </li>
  <li>Do use the subject to outline a message. A descriptive subject is more
    likely to catch the eye of the people whose eye you wanted to catch.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The above isn't an exhaustive list of guidelines, neither are any of the
  above actually &quot;enforced&quot; (although you might find one or two
  people politely suggesting you consider abiding by them). Generally speaking
  the <em>rules</em> on the Harbour lists are those that apply to good email
  composition in general.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="40"></a>4.6. Are the lists archived anywhere?<a id="MailArchives"></a></h2>
<p>You can access the developer's list at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110716032711/www.matrixlist.com/pipermail/harbour/">www.matrixlist.com/pipermail/harbour/</a>,
   the user's list at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060307012652/www.matrixlist.com/pipermail/harbourusers/">www.matrixlist.com/pipermail/harbourusers/</a>

</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="41"></a>4.7. Are there any newsgroups for Harbour?</h2>
<p>No, there are no newsgroups specific to Harbour. However, Harbour is a
  Clipper compatible compiler which means that Harbour is an on-topic subject
  for the Usenet group <a href="news:comp.lang.clipper">comp.lang.clipper</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<h3><a id="42"></a>5. Installing Harbour</h2>
<hr>
<h2><a id="43"></a>5.1. Where can I get pre-built binaries?</h2>
<p>While Harbour is still in development the preferred method of getting a
  Harbour binary is to download the source and build it yourself because this
  aids the development effort.
</p>
<p>However, the
  <a href="#WhoDevelopers">Harbour developers</a> also
  appreciate the efforts of people who don't want to develop Harbour itself
  but do want to test it and report bugs. To this end some people maintain
  Harbour binaries that are ready to be installed.
</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the following may not be the very latest cut of
  Harbour (Harbour changes by the hour while in this early phase of
  development) and that some platforms might be better supported than others.
  If you see that a platform isn't supported or is out of date please consider
  stepping in and making available binaries for that platform.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>The
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/harbour-project/files/">downloads page</a>
    on the <a href="/">Harbour project's website</a>
    contains a number of binary builds of the latest stable snapshot.
  </li>
  <li><a href="mailto:dholm@jsd-llc.com">David G. Holm</a> is
    maintaining a repository of binary builds of stable (and sometimes, in
    parallel, unstable) releases at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050909125654/harbour.netfang.net/">harbour.netfang.net/</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If you cannot find binaries for your environment via the above links then
  this means that someone isn't contributing for that environment, perhaps
  you'd care to step in and fill that gap?
</p>
<hr>
<h3><a id="44"></a>6. General Harbour questions</h2>
<hr>
<h2><a id="45"></a>6.1. When will Harbour be finished?<a id="WhenFinished"></a></h2>
<p>&quot;When it's finished&quot;.</p>
<p>Seriously, Harbour will be finished when it is finished. If the pace of
  Harbour development isn't fast enough for you you can always contribute
  something to the project to make it go faster. Such contributions could be
  code, documentation, faster machines for the
  <a href="#WhoDevelopers">key developers</a> (but one suspects a free supply of pizza would be
  more welcome) or even an offer to employ one or more of the key developers
  to work on Harbour full time.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="46"></a>6.2. Are applications &lt;attribute&gt; than CA-Clipper applications?</h2>
<p>Or, to put it another way, will your application be bigger, smaller, slower,
  faster, sexier, etc.... Generally, at least at this stage in the life of
  Harbour, any given body of code that can be compiled with Harbour and with
  <a href="#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</a>, on the same machine and with the
  same environment (it wouldn't be much of a comparison otherwise would it?)
  will run slower and will probably be &quot;bigger&quot; when compiled with
  Harbour.
</p>
<p>The same is probably true when comparing Harbour compiled code with other
  Clipper compatible compilers.
</p>
<p>The reasons for this are many and varied and, as is pointed out in many
  places in this document, Harbour is still early in its life and continuing
  development and Clipper compatibility are of greatest importance. The issue
  of &quot;performance&quot; will be addressed when it is most appropriate
  to do so, and when people are available to look into it.
</p>
<p>As always, if the performance of Harbour is an issue for you now and you
  want to see Harbour perform as per your expectations then
  <a href="#WhenFinished">contributions</a> speak louder than benchmark results.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="47"></a>6.3. What advantages does Harbour have over other Clipper compilers?</h2>
<p>The main advantage Harbour has over
  <a href="#ClipperCompilers">other Clipper compilers</a> is that it is
  <a href="#FreeSoftware">free software</a>. Harbour also attempts to remove some of the limits imposed by
  the base implementation but the extent of this will depend on your chosen
  platform.
</p>
<p>The
  <a href="#WhoDevelopers">Harbour developers</a> make no claim that
  Harbour is better or worse than
  <a href="#ClipperCompilers">any other implementation of the language</a>, however, at the same time, each individual
  developer can probably sing the praises regarding the area of Harbour they
  have worked on.
</p>
<p>Most importantly, try Harbour for yourself, decide for yourself why it has
  advantages for <strong>you</strong>.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="48"></a>6.4. What advantages do other Clipper compilers have over Harbour?</h2>
<p>Currently the advantages
  <a href="#ClipperCompilers">other Clipper compilers</a> have over Harbour are:
<ul>
  <li>They are available and working (for various values of &quot;working&quot;).</li>
  <li>They are supported.</li>
  <li>They are documented.</li>
  <li>They, to some degree, give you
    <a href="#Warranty">someone to blame</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>As time passes most of the above advantages will be eroded. Note that the
  documentation process is well under way and that support is simply a
  <a href="news:comp.lang.clipper">comp.lang.clipper</a> post away.
  The only advantage that won't be eroded is the last one in the list.
</p>
<p>I'm sure that users of
  <a href="#ClipperCompilers">other compilers</a>,
  not to mention their authors, feel they have other advantages too. This is
  fine. Harbour isn't an exercise in removing or replacing those compilers,
  Harbour is an effort to complement the
  <a href="#ClipperCompilers">list of Clipper compilers</a> with a
  <a href="#FreeSoftware">free software</a>
  offering.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="49"></a>6.5. Will Harbour support existing CA-Clipper 3rd party products?</h2>
<p>No, but the above is the wrong question to ask. The question to ask is
  &quot;will existing
  <a href="#Trademarks">CA-Clipper</a> 3rd party
  products support Harbour?&quot;, that's a question you should ask of the
  product author.
</p>
<p>See the <a href="/">Harbour website</a>
  for details of which 3rd party product authors are currently developing for
  Harbour or intend to support Harbour in the near future.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><a id="50"></a>6.6. Is Harbour a Windows development tool?</h2>
<p>No, Harbour is a cross platform

The HTML produced from harbour.sgml is now passed through a Perl script which
adds some extra colour and formatting information to make the FAQ better fit
the colour scheme of the harbour website (if you didn't notice the problem
your browser is probably dictating how you view information).

Removed the split of DOS 16/32-bit in the make details part of section 3.3.

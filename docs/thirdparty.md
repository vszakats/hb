# Free and Open Source

## [hbgi](https://github.com/tuffnatty/hbgi)

<img class="img-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3rd_gtk.svg" height="48" alt="logo">
Continuation of former project [xbGTK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbgtk/),
this project is an open source library for Linux and Windows. It allows to use
GTK+ in programs written in xBase-like languages. The library is written by Phil
Krylov. It is based on the PyGTK — Project by James Henstridge. Some files are
modified, though, to generate proper xBase code (instead of Python).

## [hbqt](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtcontribs/)

<img class="img-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3rd_qt.svg" height="48" alt="logo">
QT5 wrapper layer and IDE.

## [hbui](https://github.com/RJopek/HBUI)

Graphical user interface library for Harbour. This is a wrapper library around
[libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui), a portable, lightweight, GUI library.

## [HwGUI](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hwgui/)

Is a cross-platform GUI library for Harbour, it is written in C and Harbour.

HwGUI includes two versions: Windows and Linux. Windows version is based on
direct calls of win32 API — this allows to keep it quite fast and compact.
Linux version is based on GTK, it supports the same set of classes, commands
and functions as the Windows version, though not all yet. Thus, using some
base subset of HwGUI, you can create crossplatform GUI applications.

Currently the Windows version of HwGUI supports these C compilers: MinGW, MS
Visual C, Borland C, Pelles C and Open Watcom C.

## [MiniGUI](https://sites.google.com/site/hmgweb/)

<img class="img-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3rd_minigui.svg" height="48" alt="logo">
Harbour MiniGUI (HMG) is an xBase Windows / GUI Development System based
on Harbour MiniGUI library, Harbour MiniGUI IDE, Harbour compiler and MinGW
compiler. This implements a semi-OOP model and is a ready to use Harbour
distribution who include all needed components for your work.

[Project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/harbourminigui/).<br>
MiniGUI [unofficial build](http://www.hmgextended.com/) with _extended_ features.

## [ooHG](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oohg/)

Object-Oriented Harbour Graphical interface. This is an object-oriented style
conversion from the MiniGUI's library. Supporting existing code, and adding new
and powerful advantages of the object oriented programming.

It offers a great flexibility for the well-know MiniGUI functionality, and an
easy way to add new features with the lesser affectation to working code (anyone
can subclass any control and add its own features to it).

## [T-Gtk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/t-gtk/)

<img class="img-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3rd_gtk.svg" height="48" alt="logo">
GUI for Harbour toolkit for GTK+. This library allows to give the compilers of
Harbour from the full power of GTK + Cross-platform.

## [wxHarbour](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxharbour/)

<img class="img-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3rd_wxwidgets.svg" alt="logo">
wxHarbour is a set of Harbour language bindings for wxWidgets. Providing
a portable multi-platform GUI toolkit for Harbour.

wxWidgets lets developers create applications for Windows, macOS, GTK+, X11,
Motif, and more using one codebase. Unlike other cross-platform toolkits,
wxWidgets applications look and feel native. This is because wxWidgets uses
the platform's own native controls rather than emulating them. It's also
extensive, free, open-source, and mature.

## [xHGtk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xhgtk/)

<img class="img-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3rd_gtk.svg" height="48" alt="logo">
xHGtk is an multiplataform GUI library for Harbour. Use GTK+ to create programs
that can run in Windows and Linux. It provides a library of commands, functions
and classes for multiplatform development using Harbour, MinGW graphics library
and GTK + 2.10 or higher.

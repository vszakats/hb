# Free and Open Source

## [hbgi](https://github.com/tuffnatty/hbgi)

<img class="img-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3rd_gtk.svg" height="48" alt="logo">
Continuation of former project [xbGTK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbgtk/),
this project is an open source library for Linux and Windows. It allows to use
GTK+ in programs written in xBase-like languages. The library is written by Phil
Krylov. It is based on [PyGTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyGTK)
by James Henstridge. Some files are modified, though, to generate proper xBase
code (instead of Python).

## [hbqt](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtcontribs/)

<img class="img-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3rd_qt.svg" height="48" alt="logo">
QT5 wrapper layer and IDE.
<br><br><br>

## [hbui](https://github.com/RJopek/HBUI)

Graphical user interface library for Harbour. This is a wrapper around
[libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui), a portable, lightweight, GUI library.

## [HwGUI](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hwgui/)

Is a cross-platform GUI library for Harbour, it is written in C and Harbour.

HwGUI includes two versions: Windows and Linux. Windows version is based on
direct calls of win32 API — this allows to keep it quite fast and compact.
Linux version is based on GTK, it supports the same set of classes, commands
and functions as the Windows version, though not all yet. Thus, using some
base subset of HwGUI, you can create cross-platform GUI applications.

## [MiniGUI](https://sites.google.com/site/hmgweb/)

<img class="img-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3rd_minigui.svg" height="48" alt="logo">
Harbour MiniGUI (HMG) is an xBase Windows / GUI Development System based
on Harbour MiniGUI library, Harbour MiniGUI IDE, Harbour compiler and
a supported C compiler. This implements a semi-OOP model and is a ready to use
Harbour distribution that includes all needed components for your work.
<span class="readmore-md">[Read more](https://sourceforge.net/projects/harbourminigui/)</span>

MiniGUI [unofficial build](http://www.hmgextended.com/) with _extended_ features.

## [ooHG](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oohg/)

Object-Oriented Harbour Graphical interface. This is an object-oriented style
conversion of the MiniGUI's library. Supporting existing code, and adding new
and powerful advantages of object-oriented programming.

It offers a great flexibility for the well-known MiniGUI functionality, and an
easy way to add new features with the lesser modifications to working code
(anyone can subclass any control and add her own features to it).

## [T-Gtk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/t-gtk/)

<img class="img-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3rd_gtk.svg" height="48" alt="logo">
GUI for Harbour toolkit for GTK+. This library gives Harbour the full power
of GTK+ in a cross-platform fashion.
<br><br>

## [wxHarbour](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxharbour/)

<img class="img-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3rd_wxwidgets.svg" height="48" alt="logo">
wxHarbour is a set of Harbour language bindings for wxWidgets. Providing
a portable multi-platform GUI toolkit for Harbour.

wxWidgets lets developers create applications for Windows, macOS, GTK+, X11,
Motif and more, using a single codebase. Unlike other cross-platform toolkits,
wxWidgets applications look and feel native. This is because wxWidgets uses
the platform's own native controls rather than emulating them. It's also
extensive, free, open-source, and mature.

## [xHGtk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xhgtk/)

<img class="img-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/3rd_gtk.svg" height="48" alt="logo">
xHGtk is an multi-platform GUI library for Harbour. Uses GTK+ to create programs
that can run on Windows and Linux. It provides a library of commands, functions
and classes for multi-platform development using Harbour and GTK+ 2.10 or higher.

Managing LOCAL variables by reference
In main before ref1 x=          0
 In ref1 before ref2 =          1
  In ref2 before ref3 =          2
   In ref3 before ref4 =          3
    In ref4 =          4
   In ref3 after ref4 =          3
  In ref2 after ref3 =          3
 In ref1 after ref2 =          3
 In main after ref1 x=          3
Managing STATIC variables by reference
In main before ref1 s=         10

   In ref3 before ref4 =         13
